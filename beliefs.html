            <p>It's pretty fucking simple, people are people and should be treated as such. No matter what gender, race, sexuality, or whatever they are!</p>
            <p>People should be themselves, even if being themselves means going against everyone else's core beliefs, especially if it does.</p>
            <p>You should always be the most important person to yourself, fuck everyone else.</p>
            <p>The worst people you know are actually the status quo, you just can't tell that the others are that bad because they're better at lying.</p>
            <p>Everyone is out to get you, everyone. Be extremely careful who you trust.</p>
            <p>People do not like what you like, agree with you, think your cool, think you're nice, they're lying to you, do not trust them.</p>
            <p>You should try to be as physically fit and combat ready as possible or they will kill you.</p>
            <p>They are always looking for their next opportunity to get you.</p>
            <p>You can never keep up security forever instead try to build in mechanisms that make it less dire when you fail.</p>
